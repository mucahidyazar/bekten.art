const ME_DESCRIPTION = 'ðŸŽ¨ Greetings, I am Bekten Usubaliev, a passionate Kyrgyz painter who fervently believes that the essence of art lies in unveiling the concealed dreams, emotions, and sovereign spirit within every individual. Born in 1958, my journey in the magnificent world of art has been an exhilarating experience, marking my presence as a lecturer at the esteemed Kyrgyz State Art College since 1990. My artistic expressions have found their voice in numerous national and international exhibitions, eloquently narrating the unuttered, intricate nuances of the human soul. My creations, a harmonious blend of tradition and innovation, reside in the prestigious Kyrgyz State Museum of Fine Art and in cherished private collections across the globe.';
